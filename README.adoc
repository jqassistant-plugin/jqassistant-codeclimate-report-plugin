= jQAssistant CodeClimate Report Plugin

This is the CodeClimate Report Plugin of https://jqassistant.org[jQAssistant^].

It allows to generate JSON files in the https://github.com/codeclimate/platform/blob/master/spec/analyzers/SPEC.md#data-types[CodeClimate format] which can be used to display them e.g. in https://gitlab.com[GitLab] merge requests.

For more information on jQAssistant see https://jqassistant.org[^].
